# reveal-for-wp
A WordPress plugin for building Reveal.js presentations

Reveal Slides CPT is created

When you add a new Slide, you can then reorder the slides on the List All Slides page.

For the presentation, the plugin enqueues the necessary scripts on a page that you create. For now the name must be 'wclvpa', but I want to add a setting to allow this to be selectable.
